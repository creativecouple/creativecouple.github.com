<h2>Wait for a timeout<br/><small>or how the ugly pause turns into a beautiful in-line swan</small></h2>
<p>Imagine you have a long jQuery invocation chain, and now you want that at some point the invocation waits for short moment (500ms) before continuing.</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
$('.some').show().children().doThat() .doSomething().hide();
              /* insert a pause here ⇑, please */
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
With classical tools you now have to split up your chain and put the second part into a new callback function:
</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
$('.some').show().children().doThat();
/* inserted a pause here */
window.setTimeout(function(){
      $('some').children().doSomething().hide();
   }, 500);
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
You see it, right? Yes, the code gets ugly!
No one asked for a reorganization of your code &ndash; just a stupid little pause.
<br/>
Imagine what happens if they now want one more pause at another step, and then another one &ndash; aarrgghh! 
</p>

<div class="navi no-code" style="width:auto">
<h3>Waiting for a timeout</h3>
<ul>
	{% assign signature = '.wait(timeout)' %}{% include jquery-timing-list-methods.html %}
</ul>
</div>

<p>
The solution available in <abbr>tic</abbr>-style is a little <em>timing method</em> called "wait":
</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
$('.some').show().children().doThat() .wait(500) .doSomething().hide();
             /* inserted a pause here ⇑ */
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Want another pause? Fine! Just insert <code class="localAPI">.wait()</code> where you want.
</p>

<h3>Where is the <code>setTimeout()</code> gone?</h3>
<p>
As mentioned on the <a href="./">previous page</a> all the method calls after <code class="localAPI">.wait()</code> are collected and invoked later.
<em>jquery-timing</em> internally still calls <code>setTimeout()</code> but it uses a generic function that will just continue your <abbr>tic</abbr> when triggered by the timeout.
</p>

<div class="block">
<h2>Waiting for other things</h2>

<div class="navi no-code" style="width:auto">
<h3>Simple defers in <em>jquery-timing</em></h3>
<ul>
	{% assign signature = '.animate($)' %}{% include jquery-timing-list-methods.html %}
	{% assign signature = 'join' %}{% include jquery-timing-list-methods.html %}
	{% assign signature = '.load($)' %}{% include jquery-timing-list-methods.html %}
	{% assign signature = 'wait' %}{% include jquery-timing-list-methods.html %}
</ul>
</div>
<p>
The same mechanism like for pausing a while can also be applied to any other occasion of deferred callback functions.
Let's take a look from an abstract point of view:
</p>
<p>
The JavaScript concept of deferred callback functions always works like this:
</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
// do something
someObject.someRegistrationMethod(...,myCallbackFunction,...);
// do something
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
What we have to do in our <abbr>tic</abbr> is to recognize which kind of registration the developer wants.
Then we stop the <abbr>tic</abbr> and register a generic function which will continue our <abbr>tic</abbr>.
</p>
<p>
The current implementation of <em>jquery-timing</em> supports timeouts, events, the <span class="localAPI">.load()</span> function, and jQuery.Deferred objects as registration.
Using the jQuery event mechanism or the jQuery.Deferred object one can wait for other deferred triggers, too.
