<h2>Timed Invocation Chain (<abbr>tic</abbr>) vs. jQuery.Deferred</h2>

<p>jQuery also has another mechanism to handle deferrals &ndash; the <a href="//api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/">jQuery.Deferred</a> object:</p>
<blockquote cite="//api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/">
&ldquo;jQuery.Deferred, introduced in version 1.5, is a chainable utility object that can register multiple callbacks into callback queues, invoke callback queues, and relay the success or failure state of any synchronous or asynchronous function.&rdquo;
</blockquote>

<p>
That means jQuery.Deferred works well with callback functions. In contrast the <abbr>tic</abbr> concept wants to <em>remove as much callback functions out of your code as possible</em>.
So the timed invocation chain tries to achieve similar things like jQuery.Deferred, but it takes a complete different way to reach that goal.
</p>

<h3>Instant invocation</h3>

<p>The Deferred concept in jQuery allows to add callback functions even if the deferred object already resolved. In that case the callback method is invoked instantly.
Take a look at the following example:
</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
var def = new $.Deferred(); // create a Deferred object
def.done(myCallbackFunction); // register success callback

//…

def.resolve(); // succeed the Deferred
// → myCallbackFunction() has been called

def.done(myOtherCallback); // register another success callback
// → myOtherCallback() has been called immediately
{% endhighlight %} 
<p>
As you will see below the <abbr>tic</abbr> concept also provides the possibility to add later actions after its delays timed out, its waiting events triggered, or even inside of sequential and parallel loops.

<h3>API to combine <abbr>tic</abbr> with Deferred</h3>
<ul>
	{% assign signature = '.wait(deferred)' %}{% include jquery-timing-list-methods.html %}
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Combining <abbr>fxq</abbr> with <abbr>tic</abbr></h3>
<p>
Like for the <abbr>fxq</abbr> case there is also a possibility to join the concept of jQuery.Deferred with the <abbr>tic</abbr> in <em>jquery-timing</em>. 
The link on the right takes you to the API description to see how a <abbr>tic</abbr> can wait for a jQuery.Deferred object to succeed.
