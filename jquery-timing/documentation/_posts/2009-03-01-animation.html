<h2>Timed Invocation Chain vs. Effects Queue</h2>

<p>
jQuery has a built-in mechanism for scheduling animations and effects. We will call this the effects queue.
This mechanism supports a wide range of animations, delays, custom queuing and unqueuing, etc.
Nevertheless there are several differences between the queue and the chain. The following table tries to give a first idea:
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td></td><th>jQuery effects queue</th><th>timed invocation chain</th></tr>
<tr><th>underlying technique</th><td>enqueue explicite animations and effects</td><td>postpone method invocations themselves</td></tr>
<tr><th>return value of methods</th><td>same jQuery object</td><td>proxy collecting all concatenated function calls</td></tr>
<tr><th>method support</th><td>only functions being designed to enqueue something</td><td>any jQuery function that returns a jQuery object</td></tr>
<tr><th>combine animations and other actions</th><td>using nested callback functions</td><td>all in the same line</td></tr>
<tr><th>loop animations</th><td>not possible</td><td><code class="localAPI">.repeat()</code> and <code class="localAPI">.until()</code> with custom start and end conditions</td></tr>
<tr><th>method delay</th><td>via <code>window.setTimeout()</code> or <code class="jqueryAPI">.delay()</code> and <code class="jqueryAPI">.queue()</code>, using callback functions</td><td><code>.<span class="localAPI">wait</span>(<em>timeout</em>).doSomething(â€¦)</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<div class="navi no-code" style="width:auto">
<h3>combine deferred chain with animation queue</h3>
<ul>
	{% assign signature = '.animate($)' %}{% include jquery-timing-list-methods.html %}
	{% assign signature = 'join' %}{% include jquery-timing-list-methods.html %}
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Combining animation queues and deferred jQuery chains</h3>

<p>
As you can see in the table above the concepts are quite different.
Let's say it this way: the animation queue is one way to schedule effects and the deferred jQuery chain is another way to time anything.
</p>

<p>
Actually combining both concepts enables us to create complex behaviour with very few lines of code.
