<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
We have seen that with <em>jquery-timing</em> you have a lot of possibilities to clean up your code.
It's both working perfectly with old jQuery 1.2 code as well as with sophisticated jQuery.Deferred cases.
</p>

<h2>Why should I use the timed invocation chain?</h2>
<p>
The timed invocation chain technique allows to use very short syntax, to define several callback actions just in line,
and to include loops and delays in the same jQuery style. 
</p>
<p>
In a nutshell: <em>jquery-timing</em> supports
</p>
<ul>
<li>waiting for animations,</li>
<li>waiting for timeouts,</li>
<li>waiting for deferred objects,</li>
<li>waiting for events,</li>
<li>running sequential loops,</li>
<li>running parallel loops,</li>
<li>counting loop iterations,</li>
<li>inlining event handlers,</li>
<li>and the capability to glue that all together in any possible way.</li>
</ul>
