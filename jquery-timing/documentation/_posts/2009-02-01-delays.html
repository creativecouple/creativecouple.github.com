<h2>Wait for a timeout<br/><small>or how the ugly pause turns into a beautiful in-line swan</small></h2>
<p>Imagine you have a long jQuery invocation chain, and now you want that at some point the invocation waits for short moment (500ms) before continuing.</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
$('.some').show().children().doThat() .doSomething().hide();
              /* insert a pause here ⇑, please */
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
With classical tools you now have to split up your chain and put the second part into a new callback function:
</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
$('.some').show().children().doThat();
/* inserted a pause here */
window.setTimeout(function(){
      $('some').children().doSomething().hide();
   }, 500);
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
You see it, right? Yes, the code gets ugly!
No one asked for a reorganization of your code &ndash; just a stupid little pause.
<br/>
Imagine what happens if they now want one more pause at another step, and then another one &ndash; aarrgghh! 
</p>

<div class="navi no-code" style="width:auto">
<h3>Waiting for a timeout</h3>
<ul>
	{% assign signature = '.wait(timeout)' %}{% include jquery-timing-list-methods.html %}
</ul>
</div>

<p>
The solution available in deferred jQuery chain style is a nice <em>timing method</em> called "wait":
</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
$('.some').show().children().doThat() .wait(500) .doSomething().hide();
             /* inserted a pause here ⇑ */
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Want another pause? Fine! Just insert <code class="localAPI">.wait()</code> where you want.
</p>

<h3>Where is the <code>setTimeout()</code> gone?</h3>
<p>
As mentioned on the <a href="./">previous page</a> all the method calls after <code class="localAPI">.wait()</code> are collected and invoked later.
<em>jquery-timing</em> internally still calls <code>setTimeout()</code> but it uses a generic function that will just continue your invocation chain when triggered by the timeout.
</p>

<div class="block">
<h2>Waiting for other things</h2>

<div class="navi no-code" style="width:auto">
<h3>Simple defers in <em>jquery-timing</em></h3>
<ul>
	{% assign signature = '.animate($)' %}{% include jquery-timing-list-methods.html %}
	{% assign signature = 'join' %}{% include jquery-timing-list-methods.html %}
	{% assign signature = '.load($)' %}{% include jquery-timing-list-methods.html %}
	{% assign signature = 'wait' %}{% include jquery-timing-list-methods.html %}
</ul>
</div>
<p>
The same mechanism like for pausing a while can also be applied to any other occasion of deferred callback functions.
Let's take a look from an abstract point of view:
</p>
<p>
The JavaScript concept of deferred callback functions always works like this:
</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
// do something
someObject.someMethod(...,myCallbackFunction,...);
// do something
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
What we have to do in our timing method is to recognize which kind of registration the developer wants.
Then we stop the invocation chain and register a generic function which will continue the chain when triggered.
</p>
<p>
The current implementation of <em>jquery-timing</em> supports timeouts, animations, events, the <span class="localAPI">.load()</span> function, and deferred objects as registration.
<br/>
If you want can use the jQuery event mechanism or the jQuery.Deferred object to wait for any other trigger you like.
</p>

<div class="block">
<h2>Break the waiting</h2>
<div class="navi no-code" style="width:auto">
<h3>Breaking delays</h3>
<ul>
	{% assign signature = 'unwait' %}{% include jquery-timing-list-methods.html %}
</ul>
</div>
<p>
In many cases jQuery allows to unregister your methods again.
E.g. <span class="jqueryAPI">.bind()</span> and <span class="jqueryAPI">.unbind()</span>,
<span class="jqueryAPI">.on()</span> and <span class="jqueryAPI">.off()</span>,
<span class="jqueryAPI">.live()</span> and <span class="jqueryAPI">.die()</span>, or
<span class="jqueryAPI">.delegate()</span> and <span class="jqueryAPI">.undelegate()</span>. 
</p>
<p>
Our <span class="localAPI">.wait()</span> method also has a counterpart &ndash; <span class="localAPI">.unwait()</span>.
Any element on which <span class="localAPI">.unwait()</span> is called will stop waiting for any corresponding trigger from <span class="localAPI">.wait()</span>.
Thus the deferred jQuery chain will <strong>not continue</strong> for those elements.
</p>
</div>

<div class="block">
<h2>Instant invocation</h2>
<p>
When waiting for a deferred object you can have the case that the deferred is already resolved.
In that case the invocation chain continues instantly. That means that the invocation of your code behaves as if there was no wait.
</p>
</div>
