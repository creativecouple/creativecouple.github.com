<h2>Deferred jQuery Chain vs. jQuery.Deferred</h2>

<p>jQuery provides another mechanism to handle deferrals &ndash; the <a href="//api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/">jQuery.Deferred</a> object:</p>
<blockquote cite="//api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/">
&ldquo;jQuery.Deferred, introduced in version 1.5, is a chainable utility object that can register multiple callbacks into callback queues, invoke callback queues, and relay the success or failure state of any synchronous or asynchronous function.&rdquo;
</blockquote>

<p>
That means jQuery.Deferred works well with callback functions. In contrast the timed invocation chain concept wants to <em>remove as much callback functions out of your code as possible</em>.
So the timed invocation chain tries to achieve similar things like jQuery.Deferred, but they take different ways.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless both types, the jQuery.Deferred and any deferred jQuery chain, can be used as deferred objects wherever you need some object providing a <code>.promise()</code> method.
</p>

<div class="navi no-code" style="width:auto">
<h3>combine deferred chains with others Deferreds</h3>
<ul>
	{% assign signature = '.wait(deferred)' %}{% include jquery-timing-list-methods.html %}
	{% assign signature = '$.wait(deferred)' %}{% include jquery-timing-list-methods.html %}
	{% assign signature = 'when' %}{% include jquery-timing-list-methods.html %}
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Combining deferred objects with the deferred jQuery chain</h2>
<p>
Like for animation queues there is also a possibility to join the concept of jQuery.Deferred with the deferred jQuery chain in <em>jquery-timing</em>. 
The link on the right takes you to the API description to see how an invocation chain can wait for a jQuery.Deferred object to succeed. 
</p>
<p>
The other way round is also possible, because the deferred invocation chain itself is a deferred object providing a <code>.promise()</code> method.
That's why it can be used like any other deferred object.
Hence it can be used even in other invocation chains to wait for. Or you use it toegther with <code>$.when(â€¦)</code>. 
</p>
