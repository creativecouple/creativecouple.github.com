<h2>Where is my chain right now?</h2>
<p>jQuery provides the possibility to clone any jQuery selection object via:</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
var $some = $('#myID').parent().siblings();
var $new = $($some);
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Now we have two jQuery objects with the same elements selected.
The obvious difference between them is that they are now different JavaScript objects.
Another difference is that $some.end() points to the parent of the element #myID while $now.end() doesn't.
</p>

<p>Well, as expected you can do the same cloning with any deferred jQuery chain:</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
var $some = $('#myID').wait(500).siblings().remove();
var $new = $($some);
{% endhighlight %}
<p>The big question is: What is the content of the jQuery object $new now?
</p>
<p>
To answer that question we need to know that <code>$(deferredJQuery)</code> just clones the jQuery selection of the invocation chain in this very moment.
You can understand this like taking a snapshot. You then see which elements your chain is handling right now.
</p>
<p>Now the answer: $new just points to the element #myID, because the siblings are selected half a second later.
</p>
<p>
But when we wait for a second and then call <code>var $other = $($some)</code> then the new jQuery selection object $other points to the removed siblings of #myID.
</p>
