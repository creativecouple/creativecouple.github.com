<h2>Where is my <abbr>tic</abbr> now?</h2>
<p>jQuery provides the possibility to clone any jQuery selection object via:</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
var $some = $('#myID').parent().siblings();
var $new = $($some);
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Now we have two jQuery objects with the same elements selected.
The difference between them are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>they are different JavaScript objects</li>
<li>$some.end() points to the parent of the element #myID while $now.end() doesn't.
</ul>

<p>Well, as expected you can do the same thing with any <abbr>tic</abbr>:</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
var $some = $('#myID').wait(500).siblings().remove();
var $new = $($some);
{% endhighlight %}
<p>The big question is: What is the content of $new now?
<br/>
To answer that question we need to know that $(<abbr>tic</abbr>) just clones the jQuery selection of the <abbr>tic</abbr> in this moment.
You can understand this like taking a snapshot to see, which elements the <abbr>tic</abbr> is handling right now.
</p>
<p>Now the answer: $new just points to the element #myID, because the siblings are selected half a second later.
<br/>
But when we wait for a second and then call <code>var $other = $($some)</code> then the new jQuery selection object $other points to the removed siblings of #myID.
