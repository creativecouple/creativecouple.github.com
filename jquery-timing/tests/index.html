<h2>What the test suite is about</h2>
 
 <p>More than 500 different test cases checked against 11 different jQuery versions for both plain and minimized script 
 &mdash; the result are &gt;10k single test runs.</p>
 
 <p>Compared to the source code (25KB) and the production script (2K minified, gzipped) we are super proud to have nearly 500KB of test code.</p>
 
 <p class="description">If you want to be sure that <em>jquery-timing</em> plugin works correct in your browser just start any number of tests.</p>
 
</div>

<div class="block">
<h2>Start on your own</h2>
<p>
At some time we will include an option to pass the test results back to the developer.
For now you can just run all tests for yourself and enjoy them passingâ€¦

Hint: To safe CPU power the tests don't start on page load. You have to click first to let them run.
