<h2>What is the test suite about</h2>
 <p>More than 400 different test cases checked against 11 different jQuery versions for both plain and minimized script version
 &mdash; the result are almost 10k single test runs checking each constellation.</p>
 
 <p class="description">If you want to be sure that this plugin works correct in your browser just start any number of tests.</p>
</div>

<div class="block">
<h2>Start on your own</h2>
<p>
In short future we will include an option to pass the test results back to the developer.
For now you can just run all tests for yourself and enjoy them passingâ€¦
