words:
  - one
  - two
  - three

*** A simple jekyll test case ***

There is an array given with {{ page.words | size }} entries: [{{ page.words | join:',' }}].

Let's join these words using a for-loop:
{% assign sentence = '' %}
{% for word in page.words %}
Sentence before iteration: "{{ sentence }}"
Next word: {{ word }}
{% capture sentence %}{{ sentence }}{{ word }} {% endcapture %}Sentence after iteration: "{{ sentence }}"
=====
{% endfor %}

Let's split this sentence up with the blank character:
With the command {{'{{'}} sentence | split:' ' | size {{'}}'}} we count {{ sentence | split:' ' | size }} words.
And glue them together again with {{'{{'}} sentence | split:' ' | join:',' {{'}}'}} gaining [{{ sentence | split:' ' | join:',' }}].
